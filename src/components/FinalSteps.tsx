            <p>Gorgeous work. These letters still don't seem quite right, however. There is one final step needed before the 6 year truth is unveiled. All that is left to guide you is a riddle and a key. The rest is up to you, brave warrier.</p>
            <p><strong>KEY:</strong> int(years spent dating since tomakun + 1) * -1</p>
            <p><strong>RIDDLE:</strong>
                <blockquote>
                In the world of secrets, I quietly reign,
                Shuffling letters, I hide the plain.
                When treachery struck on a day so grim,
                My method danced in whispers dim.

                A simple shift, a subtle twist,
                In clandestine messages, I exist.
                Named for a leader of ancient fame,
                My ciphered code remains the same.

                What am I, in the realm of code?
                A tool of mystery, in a cryptic abode.
